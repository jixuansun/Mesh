<td>Inspiration: What's the universe like in your imagination? The UNIVERSE may be infinite, but we can only see a finite section of it due to the finite speed of light. A polygon MESH is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of an object in 3D computer graphics.</td>
<td>Interactive using mouse and projection mapping on a 3D Model.</td>
